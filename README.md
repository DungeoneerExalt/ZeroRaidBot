## Purpose
The main purpose of this bot is for the Dungeoneer Exalt Discord server. This server is a complete rework of the original Dungeoneer server. 

## Project Layout
For this repository, the `master` branch is the developer's branch. In other words, the branch where unstable code -- code that either won't compile, has numerous errors, is incomplete, etc. -- will be pushed. 

The `stable` branch is where code that generally has no errors will reside. The code in the `stable` branch have been tested so there should not be any errors. The official, live bot will be using the code in the `stable` branch.

## Setup Guide
Please see this [guide](https://github.com/DungeoneerExalt/ZeroRaidBot/blob/master/md_img/SETUP.md).
