# ZeroRaidBot
A [Realm of the Mad God](https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/) Discord Bot designed for verification, moderation, and raid management.

At this time, there is no official public version of the bot.

## Requirements (Latest Version)
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Purpose
The main purpose of this bot is for the Dungeoneer Exalt Discord server, where I will be the co-owner and Administrator. This server is a complete rework of the original Dungeoneer server. 

## Project Layout
For this repository, the `master` branch is the developer's branch. In other words, the branch where unstable code -- code that either won't compile, has numerous errors, is incomplete, etc. -- will be pushed. 

The `stable` branch is where code that generally has no errors will reside. The code in the `stable` branch have been tested so there should not be any errors. The official, live bot will be using the code in the `stable` branch.

## Installation Guide
