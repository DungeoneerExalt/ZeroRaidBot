# ZeroRaidBot â‡’ Agreement
Before hosting your own instance of this bot, please read through this document carefully. By hosting your own instance of this bot, you automatically agree to everything in this document. 
- "I" refers to the developer of this project.
- "You" and "your" refers to you, the person making a new instance of this project.
- This agreement applies to your own instance of this bot OR the public instance of this bot (coming soon). 

### I. Damages & Issues
1. I am NOT liable for any damages that have occurred as a result of using this bot.
2. I am NOT liable for any damages or issues that *may* occur as a result of using this bot.
    - If you find any issues, it is your responsibility to report it. It may take me up to a few weeks to resolve those issues, depending on the severity.  

### II. Additional Stuff (Added 2/8/2021)
RealmEye has recently done something to their SSL certificates, which has caused the **public RealmEye API** (linked in the README) to not work. This means that the verification module in the **stable** and **preview** branch will NOT work as intended if you choose to use the public API. You are responsible for cloning, editing (to make it work with the new changes), and self-hosting the public RealmEye API code. I will **not** provide any support for this.
